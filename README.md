# E-commerce Website with React and Vite

This is a single-page application (SPA) E-commerce website built using React and Vite. It retrieves dummy store data from [fakestoreapi.com](https://fakestoreapi.com/) to showcase products. The website is responsive thanks to Bootstrap, and React Router Dom is used for navigation. Data is fetched using the Fetch API, and a loader is implemented for a smoother user experience.
